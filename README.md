# vertigo
VHDL parser written in Ruby.

Vertigo is today able to parse a large subset of VHDL'93.

Vertigo aims at providing a managable tool for VHDL inspection and transformation.

A "tests" directory contains various VHDL files that can be parsed.
To run the test in this directory, run :
ruby run_test_parser.rb
