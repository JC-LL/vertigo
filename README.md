# vertigo
VHDL'93 VHDL parser handwritten in Ruby

Note : Vertigo parser is a work in progess.

Vertigo is not usable yet, but is able to parser a large subset of VHDL'93.

The work on the AST has started.

A "tests" directory contains various VHDL files that can be parsed.
To run the test in this directory, run run_test_parser.rb.
